 # Mixed Messages Project
 
 ## Description
 This is the first project I have ever linked with a remote repository. I made it to practice git commands, and to get a feel for how repositories work.
 
 The objective of this CodeCademy assignment was to create a program that would produce a string message. Each time the program is run, a new, randomized output message should materialize. The message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

 ## Features
 1. A reusable Math function that will find a random number between two given integer parameters.
 2. A function that selects randomly from an array at different probabilities.
